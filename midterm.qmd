To access Github from the lab, you will need to make sure you are logged in as follows:

-   username: **.\\daladmin**
-   password: **Business507!**

Remember to

-   create your PAT using `usethis::create_github_token()` ,
-   store your PAT with `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` ,
-   set your username and email with
    -   `usethis::use_git_config( user.name = ___, user.email = ___)`
:::

## Overview

The midterm will be released on Monday, October 30, and is designed to be completed in 60+ minutes.

The exam will consist of two parts:

1.  **Part 1 - Conceptual:** Simple questions designed to evaluate your familiarity with the written course notes.
2.  **Part 2 - Applied:** Data analysis in RStudio (like a usual lab, but simpler).

Log in to *your* github account and then go to the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/bsmm-8740-fall-2023) for the course and find the **BSMM-midterm-\[your github username\]** repository to complete the exam.

Create an R project using your `midterm` repository (remember to create a PAT, etc., as in lab-1) and add your answers by editing the `midterm.qmd` file in your repository. Your first edits should be to the **date** and **your name** (as author) at the top of this document.

Be sure that you have [saved]{.underline}, [staged]{.underline}, [committed]{.underline}, and [pushed]{.underline} your work before the end of the exam.

🍀 Good luck! 🍀

Recall that the first step of a decision-tree regression model will divide the space of predictors into 2 parts and estimate constant prediction values for each part. For one predictor, the result of the first step is

$$such that

# Quiz-1 (part 2)

## Q9

For the data below, it is expected that the response variable y can be described by the independent variables x1 and x2. This implies that the parameters of the following model should be estimated and tested

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x1 + \beta_2x2 + \epsilon, \epsilon ∼ \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
$$

```{r}
dat <- tibble::tibble(
  x1=c(0.58, 0.86, 0.29, 0.20, 0.56, 0.28, 0.08, 0.41, 0.22, 0.35, 0.59, 0.22, 0.26, 0.12, 0.65, 0.70, 0.30
        , 0.70, 0.39, 0.72, 0.45, 0.81, 0.04, 0.20, 0.95)
  , x2=c(0.71, 0.13, 0.79, 0.20, 0.56, 0.92, 0.01, 0.60, 0.70, 0.73, 0.13, 0.96, 0.27, 0.21, 0.88, 0.30
        , 0.15, 0.09, 0.17, 0.25, 0.30, 0.32, 0.82, 0.98, 0.00)
  , y=c(1.45, 1.93, 0.81, 0.61, 1.55, 0.95, 0.45, 1.14, 0.74, 0.98, 1.41, 0.81, 0.89, 0.68, 1.39, 1.53
        , 0.91, 1.49, 1.38, 1.73, 1.11, 1.68, 0.66, 0.69, 1.98)
)
```

Calculate the parameter estimates ( $\hat{\beta}_0$, $\hat{\beta}_1$, and $\hat{\beta}_2$); in addition find the usual 95% confidence intervals for $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}
# your code goes here

Hint: use `broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE)` with a regression model
:::

Bonus: using the `.resid` column created by `broom::augment(___, dat)` , calculate $\hat{\sigma}^2$.

## Q10

Execute the following code to read sales data from a csv file and answer the questions about the code below.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| error: false

require(magrittr)
require(ggplot2)

# read sales data
sales_dat <-
  readr::read_csv("data/sales_data_sample.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    orderdate = lubridate::as_date(orderdate, format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")
    , orderdate = lubridate::year(orderdate)
  )

```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER :

Without executing the code:

-   describe the result of the **`clean_names`** step.
-   describe the result of the **`mutate`** step.
:::

## Q11

Using the sales data that was loaded in the last question, describe what the group_by step does in the code below, and complete the code to produce a sales summary by year, i.e. productline and years are the columns (one column for each year), while each year column contains the sales for each productline that year. Execute your code to confirm that it is doing what you expect.

```{r}
#| eval: false
  sales_dat %>% 
    dplyr::group_by(orderdate, productline) %>% 
    dplyr::summarize( sales = sum(___) ) %>% 
    tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = ___, values_from = ___)
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER :

-   the result of the **`group_by`** step is:

-   the sales summary table produced by the code is given below

```{r}
# executed code

```

## Q12

Execute the following code to read salary data from a csv file and perform the following analyses.

-   code an ordinary linear regression to estimate the best linear relationship between monthly salary (the outcome, in \$000's) and months of experience.
-   extract the residuals from the fit object( using fit\$residuals) and show the qqplot (using `qqnorm`) for the residuals.
-   which assumption of ordinary linear regression does the qqplot validate.
-   is the assumption satisfied in this case?

```{r}
#| echo: true
salary_dat <-
  readr::read_csv("data/Experience-Salary.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

## Q13

Execute the following code to read student performance data from a csv file and code the following analyses where the outcome/target variable is **performance_index**, and all other columns are predictors.

-   use `rsample::initial_split` to create training and test datasets, and extract the training and test datasets using the corresponding `rsample::?` functions
-   use `recipes::recipe` to preprocess the data by normalizing the numeric predictors and creating dummy variables for the nominal predictors
-   prep the recipe you created and then use it with recipes::bake applied to the **training** dataset to create a analysis dataset.
-   run an ordinary linear regression to predict **performance_index** from the predictors, using the analysis dataset. Save the fit object.
-   use `broom::augment` (fit, data) to combine your linear fit with the corresponding training data. This step gives a tibble with a `.resid` column that is the difference between the prediction and the observed value.
-   use the .resid column to calculate the mean squared error (mse) of the fit to the training data.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
performance_dat <-
  readr::read_csv("data/Student_Performance.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}
#| eval: false
splits <- rsample::initial_split(performance_dat)
training <- ?
testing <- ?

rec <- training %>%
  recipes::recipe(performance_index ~ .) %>% 
  recipes::step_ ?  %>% 
  recipes::setp_ ?
  
performance_fit <- lm(performance_index ~ .,
   data = ?)  

result <- broom::augment(?,?)

result %>% 
  dplyr::mutate( mse = ?)

## Q14

Execute the following code to read employee absence data from a *.xls* file and create a recipe to preprocess the data. Do the following:

-   familiarize yourself with the data using `skimr::skim()` ,
-   describe what each step of the recipe is doing,
-   split the data into training and test sets, where the training set represents 80% of the data (the default is 75%).
-   add the missing arguments to the code that trains an xgboost model. You will need to prep the recipe & bake the prepped recipe. Finally you will need to ensure your argument is a matrix, by using `as.matrix()` .
-   pull the top 10 predictors from the model using `xgboost::xgb.importance(model = ., top_n = 10)`
-   finally, plot the top 10 predictors. What it the most important predictor of absenteeism time per this model?

```{r}
#| eval: false
dat <-
  readxl::read_xls("data/Absenteeism_at_work.xls") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # drop id, because it has no predictive value
  # drop reason_for_absence because it has too much predictive value
  dplyr::select( -c(id, reason_for_absence) )

absenteeism_rec <- dat %>%
  recipes::recipe(absenteeism_time_in_hours ~ .) %>%
  recipes::step_mutate(
    month_of_absence   = ifelse(month_of_absence>0, month.name[month_of_absence], "unknown")
